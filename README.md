# 🌌 Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning
<div>This project uses machine learning techniques to detect exoplanets based on NASA's Kepler Dataset. By applying models like Logistic Regression and ensemble methods, the project aims to identify potential exoplanets efficiently.</div>
<div>🪐Exoplanets are planets located outside our solar system</div>
